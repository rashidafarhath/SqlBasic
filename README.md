# SqlBasic
This is a basic SQL code. Here i have created some tables and inserted details to them in an ordinary way. In addition i have added some queries where you could get details according to the queries.
NOTE: THE WAY I ADDED DETAILS TO THE TABLE IS AN ORDINARY WAY. YOU CAN ADD DETAILS IN A SIMPLE WAY WITHOUT USING 'INSERT INTO' FOR EVERY NEW DETAILS.
